Instructed by the creator of the [Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org/), this course presents the functional aspect of Scala. The lectures are well designed, and the assignments (especially the last one) are both challenging and fun. I took that course without any functional background, so I find the pace a little bit fast. If you never do Functional programming before, I suggest taking a more basic course like University of Washington's Programming Languages.
