This website is a static site that initially built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). In 2017, it migrated to the current stack of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It initially only served as a blog, and I add more sections to it over time.
